# Lecture 12.5 – Building Dashboards (Grafana / Cloud Tools)

## Human Transcript

Dashboards make metrics actionable. Use Grafana, Datadog, or cloud-native tools.

**Key dashboards for ML**:

1. **Overview Dashboard**: Health at a glance. Green/red status, key metrics.

2. **Performance Dashboard**: Latency trends, throughput, errors over time.

3. **Model Dashboard**: Prediction distribution, drift scores, accuracy (if available).

4. **Resource Dashboard**: CPU, memory, GPU utilization across pods.

Design principles:
- Most important info at top
- Clear time ranges
- Drill-down capability
- Consistent color coding

A good dashboard answers "Is everything OK?" in 5 seconds.
