# Lecture 1.1 – Course Welcome & How to Use This Course

---

## Welcome!

Hey there! I'm really glad you're here. Welcome to this MLOps course.

Let me start by telling you what this course is—and what it isn't.

This is not one of those courses where I throw definitions at you and expect you to memorize them. No. This is a course where we build things together. We get our hands dirty. We break things. We fix them. And by the end, you'll have a real, working machine learning system that you can deploy to production.

Sounds good? Let's go.

## What You'll Learn

By the time you finish this course, you'll be able to:

- **Build an end-to-end ML pipeline** – From raw data all the way to a model serving predictions in production.
- **Version everything** – Your code, your data, and your models. So you can always go back to "what was working."
- **Automate deployments** – No more "Hey, can you run this script on the server?" emails.
- **Monitor your models** – Know when things are working and when they're not.
- **Work like a professional** – Use the same tools and practices that real MLOps teams use at companies like Netflix, Uber, and Google.

## How This Course Is Structured

This course has **15 sections**. Each section builds on the previous one.

Here's the flow:

1. **Foundation (Sections 1-3)**: We'll cover what MLOps is, why it matters, and how to think about ML systems.

2. **Project Setup (Section 4)**: We'll define a real project that we'll build throughout the course.

3. **Core Skills (Sections 5-9)**: Data handling, experimentation, model packaging, versioning, and pipelines.

4. **Deployment & Operations (Sections 10-13)**: CI/CD, deployment patterns, monitoring, and security.

5. **Capstone & Career (Sections 14-15)**: We put everything together and talk about how to land an MLOps job.

## How to Use This Course

Here's my advice:

### 1. Don't Skip Sections

I know it's tempting to jump to "the cool stuff" like Kubernetes or CI/CD. But if you skip the foundation, you'll be confused later. Trust me. Start from the beginning.

### 2. Follow Along with the Code

Every lecture that has commands or code—run them yourself. Don't just read. Doing is learning.

### 3. Use the Project

We'll build a real project throughout this course. It's your playground. Experiment with it. Break it. Fix it.

### 4. Take Notes

I write these lectures in simple English on purpose. But your notes will be in your own words. Those are more valuable.

### 5. Ask Questions

If something doesn't make sense, pause. Think about it. Look it up. Or come back to it later after more context.

## What You'll Need

Here's the minimum setup:

- **A computer** – Mac, Windows, or Linux. All work.
- **Basic Python skills** – You should know what a function is, how to write a loop, and how to install packages.
- **Terminal/Command Line** – You'll spend a lot of time here. If you're not comfortable with it yet, don't worry—we'll walk through everything.
- **Git installed** – We'll use Git a lot. If you don't have it, we'll install it in Section 2.
- **Docker installed** – We'll containerize everything. Again, Section 2 covers installation.

That's it. You don't need a powerful computer. You don't need GPUs. You don't need a cloud account (though we'll use one optionally later).

## The Teaching Philosophy

Let me be honest with you.

MLOps is not complicated. It's just... a lot. There are many tools, many concepts, many ways to do things.

My job in this course is to:

1. **Cut through the noise** – Focus on what matters, skip what doesn't.
2. **Teach you the "why"** – Not just "run this command," but "here's why we run this command."
3. **Build your intuition** – So when you see a new tool or problem, you'll know how to approach it.

I'm not going to make this harder than it needs to be. If I can explain something simply, I will. If something is complex, I'll break it down.

## A Quick Story

Let me tell you why I care about this.

A few years ago, I built a machine learning model. It worked great in my Jupyter notebook. I was proud of it. I showed it to my manager. She said, "Great, can we deploy this by Friday?"

I froze.

I had no idea how to take that model and make it available for other systems to use. I didn't know how to package it. I didn't know how to deploy it. I didn't know how to monitor it.

That weekend, I learned. The hard way.

This course exists so you don't have to learn the hard way.

## Let's Get Started

Alright, enough introduction. Let's start learning.

In the next lecture, I'll explain what MLOps actually is. But I won't give you a boring definition. I'll tell you a story instead.

See you there.
